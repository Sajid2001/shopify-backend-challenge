## How this server works

This server is an inventory tracking application. You can see, add, change, and delete items inside the inventory. As part of the extra feature requirement, this server can also add items to a warehouse. You can create a warehouse, see all the different warehouse locaitons, and push a new item to the warehouse.

All data in the server is connected to a MongoDB database. 

Use npm start to start the server and also use Postman or the Thunder Client VSCode extension to test out the server.
